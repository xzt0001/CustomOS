# CustomOS: A Minimal ARM64 Kernel

A clean, minimal operating system kernel written from scratch for AArch64 (ARMv8-A) using QEMU.  
Includes UART logging, stack setup, physical memory management, virtual memory mapping, MMU activation, context switching, and exception handling.

Future Roadmap:

Phase 4: File System and Storage
	â€¢	Implement a RAM-based filesystem (tmpfs-like).
	â€¢	Add support for basic file operations (open, read, write, close).
	â€¢	Begin building a persistent storage backend (simple EXT2-like structures).

Phase 5: User Management and Process Isolation
	â€¢	Implement user authentication and account management.
	â€¢	Enforce user-space vs kernel-space privilege separation.
	â€¢	Strengthen process isolation to prevent unauthorized memory access.

Phase 6: Networking and Basic Security
	â€¢	Build a basic TCP/IP networking stack.
	â€¢	Add rudimentary network encryption for communication security.
	â€¢	Prepare infrastructure for multi-process and remote interactions.


Research Platform Expansion

Pegasus-Class APT Simulation and Defense

This project will evolve into a kernel-level research testbed capable of simulating Pegasus-style Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) within a custom-built ARM64 operating system.

Phase 2A: Implant Simulation
	â€¢	Simulate stealth implant delivery via syscall injection or rogue process spawning.
	â€¢	Model privilege escalation via corrupted syscall tables or page mappings.
	â€¢	Build persistence mechanisms across reboots via injected hooks or init hijacking.
	â€¢	Emulate data exfiltration channels through UART and memory scanning.
	â€¢	Implement anti-forensics techniques such as self-deletion and memory unlinking.

Phase 2B: OS-Level Defenses
	â€¢	Syscall Trace Monitor to detect anomalous syscall flows.
	â€¢	Memory Integrity Zones enforced via page table protections and MMU traps.
	â€¢	Secure Logging Kernel (append-only in-memory logs protected against tampering).
	â€¢	Heuristic-based behavioral engine to detect suspicious transitions and persistence attempts.
	â€¢	Emergency Containment Protocols to isolate compromised processes or trigger safe reboots.

Phase 2C: Experimental Evaluation
	â€¢	Attack Chain Graphs to visualize multi-stage APT behavior (drop â†’ escalate â†’ persist â†’ exfiltrate).
	â€¢	Threat Model document describing attacker assumptions and TCB boundaries.
	â€¢	Evaluation Matrix to measure detection speed, containment time, and system impact.
	â€¢	Research Abstract framing this work for potential workshop or conference submission.


Long-Term Vision

The CustomOS platform will serve as:
	â€¢	A low-level systems security research environment.
	â€¢	A teaching and experimentation tool for OS security concepts.
	â€¢	A reproducible framework for studying real-world attack models and defense strategies.

Work will continue toward memory integrity enforcement, syscall verification, containment protocols, and formal verification of critical subsystems.

## Debugging Methodology: MMU Enablement Case Study

My approach to debugging the complex MMU transition problem demonstrates the systematic methodology used throughout this project:

### 1. Problem Instrumentation
Added comprehensive logging at critical transition points, capturing:
- Register state before/after MMU enablement
- Page table entry validity
- Memory mapping verification
- Stack alignment checks
- Executable permission verification

### 2. Hypothesis-Driven Debugging
Identified three potential failure points:
- Vector table accessibility post-MMU enablement
- Program counter translation continuity
- Exception handling race conditions

### 3. Controlled Experiments
For each hypothesis, I implemented targeted solutions:
- Direct mapping of vector table to known virtual address
- Identity mapping of transition code
- VBAR_EL1 update sequencing

### 4. Verification
Verified each solution through:
- Memory permission bit inspection
- Register state validation
- Execution continuity testing

This methodical approach allowed me to solve one of ARM64's most challenging bootstrapping problems: maintaining execution flow while fundamentally changing the memory addressing model.

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### MMU UART String Output Fix

The UART string output issues after MMU enablement have been resolved with a comprehensive approach:

1. **Global String Buffers**: Added global static buffers (aligned to cache lines) for safe string storage during MMU transition.

2. **Improved Cache Maintenance**: Implemented explicit cache line cleaning/invalidation with proper barriers for UART strings.

3. **TLB Invalidation**: Fixed TLB invalidation with proper inner-shareable domain instructions (`tlbi vmalle1is` instead of `tlbi vmalle1`).

4. **Memory Barriers**: Enhanced synchronization with proper barriers (DSB ISH, ISB) across all critical MMU transitions.

5. **Emergency UART Functions**: Added assembly-based UART access functions that bypass normal C code hazards.

6. **Hardened String Handling**: Modified string output functions to use global buffers and guard against dereference hazards.

7. **UART MMIO Mapping**: Improved UART device memory mapping with explicit cache maintenance and TLB invalidation.

8. **Diagnostic Capabilities**: Added extensive diagnostic output during the MMU transition for debugging.
