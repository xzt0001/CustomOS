## Hardware Platform

- The project is currently actively developed and tested on QEMU (ARM64 virt) and about to move toward Raspberry Pi 5 hardware soon.
- Early-stage debugging, feature validation, and kernel bring-up will be performed directly on Pi to ensure real-world fidelity from the early stage.
- All adversarial simulation modules—including Pegasus-style red team scenarios—will be validated in an air-gapped Raspberry Pi 5.
