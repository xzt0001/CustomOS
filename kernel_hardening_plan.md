**This document will serve as the living blueprint for all future security enhancements, adversarial mitigations, and formal kernel-hardening features for this project.**

## Purpose

While this platform is fundamentally about adversarial simulation and historical systems critique, it is equally committed to robust, research-grade defense. All security features—past, present, and future—will be documented here, including experimental mitigations, threat modeling, and empirical results.

## Guiding Sources

The following will inform and inspire the hardening roadmap:
- **Linux Kernel Codebase:** Established best practices, mitigation techniques, and lessons from open-source evolution.
- **Apple Security Research:** Innovative approaches to iOS/macOS kernel hardening, including PAC, KTRR, and secure boot.
- **Threat Vector Writeups:** Up-to-date analysis from public APT research, exploit writeups, and academic literature.
- **Original Research and Questions:** Insights and hypotheses developed through my own research from other sources and conversations with AI.

## Status

*The detailed hardening roadmap is under active development and will be published in this document as the project advances through its next phases.*

*Serious researchers, red teamers, and security professionals are invited to contribute ideas, review future plans, or propose new threat models.*
